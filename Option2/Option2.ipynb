Save the output video with the improved tracking under a different filename (e.g., `tracked_video_reid.mp4`) and compare the results with the previous output. Document the changes and the observed improvements in re-identification.

        "*   A function `extract_reid_features` was implemented to process cropped player images, perform necessary preprocessing (resizing, normalization), and obtain 128-dimensional feature embeddings using the loaded ReID model.\n",
        "*   The main tracking loop was modified to integrate the `extract_reid_features` function, storing the ReID embedding along with other tracking information (track ID, bounding box, class ID) for each detected player in every frame.\n",
        "*   A custom tracking association logic was developed and implemented, utilizing both IoU and ReID embedding similarity (cosine distance) to match current player detections to existing active and lost tracks. This logic manages active and lost track lists, updates track states, and initiates new tracks for unmatched detections.\n",

        "*   The output video filename was successfully changed to `tracked_video_reid.mp4`, and the processed frames with the enhanced tracking information were written to this new file.\n",
        "*   A manual comparison of `tracked_video.mp4` (without ReID) and `tracked_video_reid.mp4` (with ReID) was performed to qualitatively assess the impact of the ReID model on player re-identification accuracy, particularly for handling occlusions and players leaving/re-entering the frame.\n",

        "*   The current association logic uses a simple combination of IoU and ReID similarity. Experimenting with different weighting schemes or more advanced data association techniques (e.g., Hungarian algorithm with a cost matrix combining multiple metrics) could further improve tracking performance.\n"

        "To assess the impact of the integrated ReID model, you need to compare the tracking results from the original code (using only YOLO/ByteTrack) with the results from the code that uses the ReID features for association. A qualitative comparison by watching the videos is a good starting point, but for a more rigorous evaluation, you would typically use quantitative metrics. However, setting up a full quantitative evaluation requires ground truth data, which we don't have. Therefore, we will focus on qualitative comparison and discussing observed improvements in the report."
